Nine years ago, we were the leading self-service kiosk vendor in China, deploying approximately 100 to 200 kiosks in top hospitals, with at least 10 in smaller ones.

Our primary challenge revolved around collecting lab reports and diagnostic data from around 3000 hospitals in China. These reports varied significantly in layout and terminology due to different vendors, and even within the same vendor, there were numerous versions, including customized ones for large hospitals. Each hospital typically had between 100 and 300 different report layouts. Our task was to extract data from these reports, present it on a mobile app for users, and ensure it printed correctly formatted on our self-service kiosks.
